# Public NMR Data
The `experiments_1D1H` folder contain NMR data that are used in the example tutorials or publications that based on our libraries. The experiments are contributed by the National Research Council of Canada and its collaborators through the [NRC Challenge Program initiative](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/programs/challenge-programs).

The `input` folder contain sample configuration and coupling value files that are used in the example tutorials or publications that based on our libraries. Users of these libraries are encouraged to create their own configuration and coupling value files.
